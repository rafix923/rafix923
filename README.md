- 👋 Hi, I’m Rafael Lopes.
- 👀 I am a lawyer in a career-changing to be a full-stack web developer. 
- In order to achieve this goal, I started to study by myself in December 2021. 
- But on March 28, I passed the exams for the full-stack development web course at Labenu.
- 🌱 I’m currently interested in Frontend developer Jr. jobs.  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that have the potential to help people in their lives 
and turn the world into a better place to live.
- I love to read,   play acoustic guitar, and go for a walk in the evenings at the park. 
- Then, if you ever had read a book that changed your life, let me know. I would love to read it also!
- 📫 You can reach me sending a email to rafaellopes.dev@gmail.com
