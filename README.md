👀 I am a lawyer in a career-changing to be a full-stack web developer.
To achieve this goal, I started to study by myself in December 2021.
But on March 28, 2022, I passed the exams for the full-stack development web course at Labenu.

🌱 I’m currently interested in Frontend developer Jr. jobs that offer
an intensive exchange with colleagues from all around the world,
pleasant working atmosphere and
Internal development opportunities.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that have the potential to help people in their lives and turn the world into a better place to live.

I love to go for a walk in the evenings at the park. I can't help but mention that I also love to play acoustic guitar and read books. Then, if you ever had read a book that changed your life, let me know. I would love to read it also!
